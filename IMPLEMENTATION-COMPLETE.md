## 🚀 How The System Works

### User Experience Flow:

   - Shows cached content **instantly** (< 0.5s load time)
   - Fetches fresh data from Supabase in background
   - Silently updates content when new data arrives
   - "Last updated" timestamp shows in Aktuelles section

2. **Automatic Updates:**
   - Auto-refreshes every 10 minutes while app is active
   - Auto-refreshes when app comes to foreground
   - Visual refresh button allows manual updates anytime

3. **Offline Mode:**
   - Works perfectly with cached data
   - All features available except external links
   - Syncs when connection returns

4. **News Section:**
   - Displays all published articles
   - Shows "Neu" badge for articles < 7 days old
   - Featured articles have special border styling
   - Click to view full article with back button
   - Sorted by date (newest first)
